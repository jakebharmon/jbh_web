    "text": "I am currently a graduate student studying Environmental Epidemiology at Georgia State University. I like to say I learned to code in the back of an ambulance, because it was my EMS experience which set me on this disease detective path. I am particularly passionate about promoting the health of people with disabilities, and I am a connoisseur of wonkish policies.\nI also love singing “FaSoLA” or Sacred Harp music, am an avid reader, run more than I walk, and am interested in vegetarian recipies from around the world."
