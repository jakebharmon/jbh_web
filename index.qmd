I am currently a graduate student studying Environmental Epidemiology at Georgia
State University. I like to say I learned to code in the back of an ambulance,
because it was my EMS experience which set me on this disease detective path. I am
particularly passionate about promoting the health of people with disabilities, and I
am a connoisseur of wonkish policies.

I also love singing "FaSoLA" or Sacred
Harp music, am an avid reader, run more than
I walk, and am interested in vegetarian recipies from around the world.
